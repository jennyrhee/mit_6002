# mit_6002/pset4
Used regression analysis to model the climate of different areas and try to find evidence of global warming. 

## Data
- `data.csv` - temperature data obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Contains the average temperatures observed in 21 U.S. cities from 1961 to 2015.
  - In order to parse the raw data, MIT provides a helper class `Climate`, which can be instantiated using the filename for the raw data.
